+ collate\_info.py to see who completed
+ listen to audio to clean check for audio quality/quality assurance
+ edit master.tsv to make groups for evaluation (make sure of some overlap (ref will auto overlap))
  + use create\_groups.py to make groups
  + each person can then use their id to access the files they want
  + answers get saved every 10, so that when the reload it should be ok.
  + demo answers are not changed
+ run collate\_tsv to collate tsvs
+ run collate\_text to get feedback, questionnaire, prolific ids
+ run collate\_progress to get progress
